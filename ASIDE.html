 		  <p style="color: red"> Human eyes see only visible light. Visible light is made up of all the colors of the
rainbow (sometimes labeled red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) which, when
combined, look white to our eyes. But there are many other, invisible forms of light, i.e.
the electromagnetic spectrum – radio, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma
rays. The various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are differentiated by their
wavelengths – radio wavelengths can be kilometers long and gamma ray wavelengths
smaller than atoms.
Many scientific instruments are designed to detect infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, or other
wavelengths. These invisible forms of light have no colors associated with them. So
scientists have their computers assign unusual colors (like neon orange) to their images,
to allow them to observe details. The green Sun, above left, is a photo of the Sun taken in
extreme ultraviolet light, which our eyes cannot see. The scientists have artificially
colored the ultraviolet data green. We call that “false color”.
Scientists also use false color to indicate additional information. The image of Mars,
above right, shows the concentration of methane in Mars’s atmosphere. Scientists have
color-coded the highest concentrations of methane as red, the lowest in blue, to help us
and them understand the data. Many of the images in this collection are likewise false
colored. We have tried to highlight which images come from visible light and which
represent false color or color-coded data.</p>
